<h1 align="center">Tokyo Night Dark Enhanced</h1>

an edit of [Tokyo Night Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drewxs.tokyo-night-dark) with some small changes such as adjusted syntax highlighting colors and fixes to depreciated color values.

this edit was primarily created to tweak syntax highlighting colors as some of them were not to my liking.
